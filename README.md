Reusable Utilities to Import into TwoSix Projects

The goal is to take all reusable and redundant code from specific projects
and move it into the global 'Utilities' Project. This will prevent version
differences, repeating code, and allow for efficient development. The
repository will host utilities and reusable functions for different programming langauges and can be pulled into individual
projects

## Supported Languages:

 - [python2](https://github.com/twosixlabs/utilities/tree/master/python/python2): Python 2.x Reusable Functions
 - [python3](https://github.com/twosixlabs/utilities/tree/master/python/python3): Python 3.x Reusable Functions
